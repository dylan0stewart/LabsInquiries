### What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?


### What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
As a user, i need to be able to:

create an account

log in

see a home screen

check the weather, income, and population of a specific city(1 at initial release)


### Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
### What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
check the weather, income, and population of a specific city(1 at initial release)

develop API for ETL pipeline

find data sources for each item

restructure data into form we need

write queries to pull relevant data

make sure JSON output is in form frontend can use


### After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you 
### change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

Starting at the very highest level possible. I would not have gotten into specifics of any one feature, until i had every single high-level one mapped out first




### What technical choices did you make today?

The choice to primarily use Flask for the API, and AWS  for deployment as recommended by Labs

### Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?

AWS was the harder call for me, as its not something I'm familiar with, which always makes me uncomfortable when trying to build something for production. My thought process was pretty straightforward, since there was little way around using it.

For the Flask/Fast, it came down to wanting to primarily use what I understood on a production-quality level, even if FastAPI has some great features built into it.

### Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
### Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
### In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.

I made the choices I did essentially for the sake of consistency, and confidence in the tech itself, and my understanding of the applications of it.


### According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?

The choice that balances efficiency and simplicity the best for what you need.

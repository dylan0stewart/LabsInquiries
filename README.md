As a user, i need to be able to:

create an account

log in

see a home screen

check the weather, income, and population of a specific city(1 at initial release)


### Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
### What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
check the weather, income, and population of a specific city(1 at initial release)

develop API for ETL pipeline

find data sources for each item

restructure data into form we need

write queries to pull relevant data

make sure JSON output is in form frontend can use


### After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you 
### change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

Starting at the very highest level possible. I would not have gotten into specifics of any one feature, until i had every single high-level one mapped out first
